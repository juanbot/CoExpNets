Title: Co-expression network management based on WGCNA + k-means
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Juan A. Botia

Description: This package works on gene expression profiling to create
    co-expression networks. It is based in WGCNA and a post-process 
    phase based on the k-means algorithm for a better redistribution of
    some of the genes. See details at
